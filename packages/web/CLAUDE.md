# Observations Web

This is the runnable Nuxt 4 app for Observations. It extends the `@1001-digital/observations-ui` layer, which provides all components and composables.

This package owns pages, routing (`router.options.ts`), and `app.vue`. UI components and composables live in the `ui` layer — do not duplicate them here.
