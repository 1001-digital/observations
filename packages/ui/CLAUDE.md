# Observations UI

Pure Vue component library providing components, composables, and utilities for the Observations app. This package has no framework dependency — it works with both Nuxt (`web`) and plain Vite (`lib`).

Components and composables are auto-imported by the `web` Nuxt app and explicitly imported by the `lib` Vite app.
